## Debiased Collaborative Filtering with Kernel-based Causal Balancing

This is the official pytorch implementation of Debiased Collaborative Filtering with Kernel-based Causal Balancing.


## Run the code

- For Coat, please run the file:


```python
coat.ipynb
```


- For Music, please run the file:

```python
music.ipynb
```


- For Product, please run the file:


```python
product.ipynb 
```


The code runs well at python 3.8.18. The required packages are as follows:
-   pytorch == 1.9.0
-   numpy == 1.24.4 
-   scipy == 1.10.1
-   pandas == 2.0.3
-   scikit-learn == 1.3.2
